    The future Wave 4 adds special functionality to this route,
    so for this test, we need to set-up "mocking."

    Mocking will help our tests work in isolation, which is a
    good thing!

    We need to mock any POST requests that may occur during this
    test (due to Wave 4).

    There is no action needed here, the tests should work as-is.
